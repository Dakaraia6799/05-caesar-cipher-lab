# Caeser Cipher
In cryptography, a Caesar cipher, also known as Caesar's cipher, the shift cipher, Caesar's code or Caesar shift, is one of the simplest and most widely known encryption techniques. Learn more about it at [Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caesar_cipher).

## Exercise

You'll be writing a caeser encoder and decoder. Each method takes a string and the offset. The encoder converts the letter a with an offset of 3 to the letter d. A capital letter is always converted to a capital letter i.e Z with an offset of 2 is B. Spaces and punctuation are ignored. The decoder works in reverse.
